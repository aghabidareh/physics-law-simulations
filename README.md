# physics-law-simulations
in this repository, I am implementing, simulating, the physics laws using python.

1. **Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.

2. **Newton’s Second Law**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (\( F = ma \)).

3. **Newton’s Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

4. **Law of Universal Gravitation**: Every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (\( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \)).

5. **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it.

6. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of an isolated system remains constant; energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.

7. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: The change in internal energy of a system equals the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system (\( \Delta U = Q - W \)).

8. **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: The entropy of an isolated system always increases or remains constant; heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder to a hotter body.

9. **Third Law of Thermodynamics**: As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, its entropy approaches a minimum value.

10. **Coulomb’s Law**: The force between two point charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (\( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)).

11. **Gauss’s Law for Electricity**: The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed within it (\( \Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \)).

12. **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism**: The magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero, indicating no magnetic monopoles exist.

13. **Faraday’s Law of Induction**: A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a closed loop (\( \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \)).

14. **Ampère’s Law (with Maxwell’s addition)**: The magnetic field around a closed loop is proportional to the electric current passing through it, plus the rate of change of electric flux.

15. **Hooke’s Law**: The force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from equilibrium (\( F = -kx \)).

16. **Archimedes’ Principle**: An object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.

17. **Bernoulli’s Principle**: For an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or potential energy.

18. **Planck’s Law**: The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency (\( E = h\nu \)), where \( h \) is Planck’s constant.

19. **Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle**: It is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle (\( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \)).

20. **Einstein’s Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Energy and mass are interchangeable, related by \( E = mc^2 \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
